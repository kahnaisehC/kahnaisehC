- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kahnaisehC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development, Gophers, Penguins and some cliche love story, you know what I'm talking about
- ðŸŒ± AS OF RIGHT NOW, I'm learning every day a little bit, throwing some projects here and there. This will pay off, maybe... 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me
-     Contact me via my e-mail: gabianhak@gmail.com
-     and the favouriten't social media of every developer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-hakanson/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Array/Object?
- âš¡ Fun fact: If I've got a coin for every time I'd got a girlfriend I'd have two coins, which isn't much but it's weird that it happened twice.
